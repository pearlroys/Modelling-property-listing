We recently performed a rerun of the ingestion job on November 20th due to an incident over the weekend. As part of incident response, backfilling was necessary, which inadvertently led to duplications in the availability job, currently operating in append mode.

Rest assured, our team is actively working on a solution to address this matter promptly.

Thank you for your understanding.
