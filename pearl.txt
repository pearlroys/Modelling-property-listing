Dear Team,

We would like to bring to your attention an issue with the standard active power values we are receiving from ReRskine. In some instances, we are observing active power values exceeding 1 GW, which is significantly higher than the actual power being delivered by the asset. These inaccurate values are impacting the accuracy of our other calculations.

We kindly request your assistance in investigating this matter and resolving the issue promptly. Please review the attached screenshot for an example of the erroneous active power values.

We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.
