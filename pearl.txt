Hi Sara, just to ensure I have a clear understanding, could you please clarify which table this information is extracted from? When you mention "hh_energy," are you referring to the hourly energy data table? Additionally, when you mention the value "11.66" for energy in/out, are you seeking an explanation for why this specific value is recorded?
