Hi Team,

Just wanted to check in on the recent console issues that have been impacting the Dispatch and Telemetry tabs, particularly switching between sites. We appreciate you monitoring this, but some customers have raised concerns and I wanted to see if there's any update or ongoing work to address these challenges.

Apologies if this has already been covered in another thread, I just wanted to make sure it's on our radar and gather any information available. Thanks for your time and effort on this.
