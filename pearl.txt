Temporary Solution:

We can temporarily input a manual baseline to recharge, given the current service failure.
Long-Term Options:

Increasing the SOC threshold, as proposed, may work, but it comes with the risk of reaching the upper threshold limit.
Another consideration for the long term is to reduce the tendered/bid volume.
Related Issue:

I've observed a similar problem with ticket number 509. Is it possible that this is a comparable issue, perhaps linked to an increase in the black start reserve for the assessor?

Further investigation:

Given the similar issue with ticket #509, it's worth exploring if both cases originate from an increased black start reserve. Thorough investigation of this potential connection could identify a broader solution applicable to both situations.

Please let me know your thoughts on these options and how you'd like to proceed. I'm open to discussing a combination of approaches to balance immediate needs with long-term sustainability.

Thanks,
