Hi Extra-ordinary Taco Krakenflexers,

My quarterly review is coming up onthe 18th of this month and I'm keen to gather your valuable feedback as I reflect on my accomplishments and set goals for the next quarter.

Your insights and perspectives are crucial in helping me understand my strengths and areas for improvement. I'd be grateful if you could take a few minutes to share your thoughts on my performance in the following areas:

Individual Contributions: How have I contributed to the team's success this quarter? Did I meet or exceed expectations on assigned tasks?

Collaboration: How well have I collaborated with you and other team members? Were there any instances where communication or teamwork could have been improved?

Professional Development: Did I demonstrate a commitment to learning and growth? Are there any specific skills or knowledge areas I should focus on developing further?



Any additional feedback you have to make me a better teammate would be greatly appreciated. You can respond to this email directly or feel free to schedule a quick chat if you'd prefer.

Additionally, I kindly request that you send your feedback to myself or Arran(if you prefer

) or even both, before the 18th of this month. Your input will be included in the comprehensive review process, and I believe it will contribute to a more well-rounded and accurate assessment.



Thank you in advance for your time and support. I look forward to hearing from you!
