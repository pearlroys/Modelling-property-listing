Ultimetrics and Forsa mentioned the change in the Ethernet module and their intention to monitor it for output spikes. Have you been receiving these updates? I believe Ultimetrics and Forsa would be better positioned to inform about the spikes since it's not within our control. Please let me know if I can assist in any way.
