Here's a more refined version of your message that maintains a positive and collaborative tone:

I completely agree that scheduling a dispatch at that time would have been ideal under different circumstances. However, the issue presented to the Optimizer was a scenario it wasn't designed to handle. Its core function is to manage situations within its established capabilities, and when encountered with an unforeseen problem, it's programmed to pause rather than make potentially detrimental decisions. While this might seem like inaction, it's actually the safest and most responsible course of action in such situations.

We understand the need for greater adaptability in unforeseen scenarios. As such, we're actively exploring solutions to enhance the Optimizer's capabilities in handling diverse situations while maintaining its core stability. We're confident that with collaboration and ongoing development, we can equip the Optimizer to tackle a wider range of challenges in the future.

In the meantime, I'm happy to discuss alternative solutions or answer any questions you might have. Open communication and collaboration are key to navigating these situations effectively.
