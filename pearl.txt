Initial Alert:

On Thursday (11/32 AM), we identified potential infeasibilities in Lascar due to a high DR contract size.
Continued Issues:

The infeasibilities persisted into December 20th, further impacted by a high SOE.
Impact:

These issues led to missed deliveries on certain contracts and dispatches.
Root Cause:

The Optimizer failed to schedule a dispatch despite available throughput because it predicted exceeding its limit while fulfilling all scheduled contracts.
Next Steps:

Bidding Strategy: We will explore lower bids in the future.
Throughput Limits: We will adjust the throughput limit for the virtual device while maintaining the preferred value for the physical device.
Optimizer Optimization: We will investigate improved Optimizer responses in similar situations.


Initial: Around 11:32 on Thursday, we communicated the infeasibilities in Lascar.

What happened: These infeasibilities resulted from a high Demand Response (DR) contract size. They persisted, and on December 20th, we notified about continued infeasibilities due to a high State of Energy (SOE) and manual dispatches were made.

The impact: Infeasibilities led to missed deliveries on certain contracts and dispatches.

Outcome: The optimizer failed to schedule a dispatch even when there was available throughput, anticipating limited throughput if it had to fulfill all scheduled contracts for the day.

Next steps: Bidding lower in the future, adjusting throughput limits for the virtual device while maintaining preferred throughput for physical devices, and exploring improvements in how the optimizer responds to such scenarios.
