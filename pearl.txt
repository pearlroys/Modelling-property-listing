I'd like to inform you that I've adjusted the SoC limit threshold for all [system/device name]s, not just DC, as of yesterday. This was necessary to address [briefly explain the reason for the change].

In the future, you can easily make similar adjustments yourselves using the console. I've attached a quick guide explaining the process in case it's helpful.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need assistance with using the console.
