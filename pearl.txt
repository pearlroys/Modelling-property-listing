I wanted to clarify a point regarding the recent [issue]. While a dispatch at that specific time might have been optimal, it wasn't feasible within the Optimizer's current capabilities.

The Optimizer excels at [explain its main functionalities]. Extending its scope beyond its current design could introduce unintended complexities and potentially hinder its overall performance.

I understand the desire for more advanced dispatch options, and I'm confident we can explore those in the future as the Optimizer evolves.

I observed a potential misunderstanding regarding the Optimizer's capabilities. While scheduling a dispatch at the mentioned time would have been optimal, it currently falls outside the framework of the Optimizer's functionalities.

The Optimizer is designed to excel in [highlight main functionalities, e.g., real-time adjustments within specific constraints]. Pushing it beyond these limits at this stage might not align with its intended operations.

I appreciate your understanding on this matter. If you have any further questions or suggestions, feel free to share them.
