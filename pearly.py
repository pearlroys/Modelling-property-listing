The imported and exported power for SIM3 currently stands at 49.5 MW, which exceeds the maximum limit of 25 MW for a SIM with a single device. In light of this, I'm considering the possibility of using two power devices (PDs) for this site to address the power demand effectively and maintain a balance.
