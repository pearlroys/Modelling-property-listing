Personally, I dedicated my weekends to learning, implementing what I had learned, and tackling the technical challenge. While I don't expect everyone to go to such extremes, given the short timeframe, I believe it's essential to encourage a strong work ethic. For individuals who may not have the flexibility to make such sacrifices, improved communication from both sides would be beneficial. The technical challenge can be demanding, especially when it involves back-to-back meetings with teammates and requires significant effort and critical thinking. I also want to acknowledge the assistance I received from Milan, who allowed me to allocate 3-6 hours of work time on certain days to focus on the project, which was tremendously helpful.
