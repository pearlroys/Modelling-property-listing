Subject: Resignation Letter - Health Data Scientist Internship

Dear Isaac and Milan,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to officially resign from my position as a Health Data Scientist Intern at Bupa, effective September 22nd, 2023. It is with mixed emotions that I make this decision, but I wanted to express my heartfelt gratitude for the incredible experience I've had during my three-month internship at Bupa.

I want to begin by extending my profuse thanks and appreciation for the warm welcome, guidance, and support I received from both of you. Your mentorship and the opportunities you provided have been instrumental in my growth and development as a data scientist. I am truly grateful for the chance to learn from such accomplished professionals.

I would also like to commend everyone on Saul's team, including Saul himself, Milan, Kayla, Rohan, and Adam, for their unwavering support and camaraderie. The collaborative environment within the Manchester team has been inspiring, and I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to work alongside such talented individuals.

My decision to leave Bupa is driven by a new job offer with Octopus Energy, a role that aligns with my career goals and aspirations. While I am excited about this new chapter in my professional journey, I will carry the lessons and experiences from my time at Bupa with me. I want to emphasize that this decision was not made lightly, and I am sincerely thankful for the understanding and support I have received from everyone at Bupa.

As I move forward, I want to assure you that I will keep an eye out for opportunities to collaborate and reconnect with the Bupa team in the future. The relationships I've built and the knowledge I've gained here are invaluable, and I hope to stay connected with this wonderful community.

Once again, thank you for everything. I genuinely appreciate the trust you placed in me and the kindness you showed throughout my internship. Bupa will always hold a special place in my heart, and I wish the team continued success in all your endeavors.

Please do not hesitate to reach out if there are any tasks or handovers required before my departure on the 22nd of September. I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition.

Warm regards,

[Your Name]
