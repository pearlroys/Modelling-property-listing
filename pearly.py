"Hi Milan,

I hope you're well. I wanted to share some good newsâ€”I've been offered a new job, and it's set to start on the 25th. Given this, I was wondering if it would be alright for me to speak with Joe, Saul, and Isaac about the possibility of ending my internship on the 22nd. My last presentation is scheduled for next week, and I believe this timeline would allow for a smoother transition.

Your guidance on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
