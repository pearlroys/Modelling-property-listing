**Subject: Urgent Update: Resolution of Pearl Gateway Issue**

Dear Team,

I am writing to inform you about a recent incident that came to our attention. 

**What Happened:**
We identified an issue with the Pearl Gateway. Specifically, an increase in thread activity was causing a significant slowdown, posing a potential risk to the timely delivery of services.

**The Impact:**
To avert a critical situation, we initiated a preemptive fix. Fortunately, this intervention occurred without any actual disruptions to our services.

**Outcome:**
Following the initial response, we took action to address the root cause. The gateway was manually restarted at 15:52 yesterday, effectively clearing unnecessary threads. Additionally, we have implemented a solution to stabilize the gateway, which necessitated a scheduled outage from 13:30 to 14:30. I'm pleased to report that this fix was successful and should prevent similar issues related to escalating thread counts due to reconnection errors.

**Next Steps:**
While the immediate issue has been resolved, we are committed to long-term stability. We will replace the manual fix with an automated system. Furthermore, our team will maintain continuous monitoring of the system to swiftly address any potential concerns.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
[Your Position]
