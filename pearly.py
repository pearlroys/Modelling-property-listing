**7. A Balanced Project Portfolio:** My internship experience at Bupa has been incredibly valuable, and I appreciate the clarity regarding the nature of the projects I'd be involved in, particularly during my initial discussions with Milan.

Looking ahead, I wonder if there could be an opportunity for a more balanced experience. For instance, spending a portion of the internship with a team like Saul's, focused on smaller, diverse projects, and another portion with a team like Juhin's, working on more health-related data. This balanced approach could provide interns with a broader skill set and a taste of both the healthcare and commercial sides of data science.

From my perspective, this dual exposure would have been enriching. It would be wonderful if future projects maintain the same level of engagement and depth as the NPS project Milan guided me through. Having the chance to work on two substantial projects—one centered on health data and the other on commercial data—could be immensely beneficial for aspiring data scientists like myself. It's a thought I believe could enhance the already excellent internship program at Bupa.
