Certainly, here are two succinct points for your PowerPoint presentation:

1. **Tenure Matters**: Our analysis reveals that advisor tenure plays a pivotal role in customer outcomes. Advisors with tenure ranging from 20 to 50 months consistently excel at turning customers into promoters of our services.

2. **Tenure and Sentiment**: A closer look at the summary plot further validates this trend.

These two points succinctly capture the key findings related to advisor tenure and its impact on customer sentiment.
