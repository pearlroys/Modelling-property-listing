Hi [Team Member's Name],

I hope you're having an awesome day! I was thinking it would be fantastic for us to schedule a one-on-one meeting. It's a chance for us to catch up, exchange ideas, and build a stronger bond.

Whenever you're free, just let me know, and we'll set up a time that works for both of us.

Can't wait to chat with you!
