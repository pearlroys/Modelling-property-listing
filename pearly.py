While an external project could be helpful for interviews, I believe the technical challenge already serves that purpose. Personally, I found it rewarding to contribute meaningfully to Bupa. Having personal projects solely for skill building may not be as fulfilling as the real-world challenges presented by Bupa's technical challenge and group projects.
