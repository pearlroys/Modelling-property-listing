I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to kindly inquire about my current tax code. It appears that I might be on an emergency tax code (M1) because I didn't have my P45 when I initially joined [Company Name].

Would it be possible for you to confirm whether my P45 has been successfully uploaded to my Hibob account under the "My Docs" section? Your assistance in clarifying this matter would be greatly appreciated, as it would help ensure accurate tax deductions.

Thank you for your time and support.
