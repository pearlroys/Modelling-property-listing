Certainly, here's your feedback polished for clarity and warmth:

1. **Technical Learning Focus:** It was really beneficial for me to dive deep into a few key technologies, such as SAS, while enhancing my Python skills and developing expertise in Power BI. With the limited time frame, this approach allowed me to build solid proficiency instead of spreading myself too thin over numerous technologies. Although I can't recall if this was explicitly communicated before joining, preliminary learning materials for SAS could be helpful, especially since extensive SAS training resources aren't as readily available.

2. **Hybrid Work Arrangement:** The flexibility of a hybrid work setup was fantastic. While I initially thought I would spend more time in the office, I quickly realized that I'm more productive working remotely. However, having the option to come into the office and interact with colleagues was a valuable benefit. Bupa's office space is quite impressive, and there's no reason not to make use of it from time to time.

3. **Dedication and Sacrifice:** Personally, I was willing to dedicate my weekends to learning, applying what I'd learned, and tackling the technical challenges. While I understand that not everyone can make such extreme commitments, given the short timeframe, I believe that putting in extra effort should be encouraged. For those who might not have the same flexibility, clear communication from both sides would be beneficial. The technical challenges can be demanding, especially when balancing back-to-back meetings with team collaboration. I found Milan's support, which allowed me to allocate work hours to the project, particularly helpful.

4. **Additional Projects:** I believe that most of the other projects common to other organizations are similar to what we encounter during master's programs or academic work. Bupa's approach, with its commercial focus and learning opportunities, sets it apart and is incredibly valuable in the current job market. I believe the structure is perfect as it is.

5. **External Projects:** Introducing an external project for interview preparation could be beneficial, although the technical challenge already serves this purpose. However, having an additional side project for skill development and portfolio enhancement could be worthwhile. Still, I personally appreciated the aspect of contributing something valuable to the organization. Therefore, any personal projects outside of Bupa should be optional and based on individual preferences.

6. **Healthcare Background:** For individuals with a strong healthcare background, exploring health-related projects can be particularly intriguing. Personally, I found joy and enthusiasm in working with datasets that included diseases and medical procedures. However, it should be a matter of personal choice. During casual conversations with other interns, I learned that many do not have a healthcare background but are open to data science internships. Therefore, project preferences should be tailored to each individual's interests and expertise.

7. **Project Duration:** My initial understanding of project duration was clear, at least during my first call with Milan before joining. However, I wonder if extending the duration of projects to around 7 weeks, possibly with smaller teams and some focused on health data, could be considered. I definitely would have enjoyed that. Having time for two well-sized projects that prepare interns for both commercial and health-related data roles could be incredibly beneficial. This approach could provide a more comprehensive internship experience.

In conclusion, Bupa's unique approach to internships sets it apart from other organizations, and it's something to be envied. I've thoroughly enjoyed my time here and appreciate the balance between commercial and health-focused projects. Providing interns with a mix of both experiences could be highly advantageous.




1. Definitely getting deep experience in a few technologies say 2/3 would be more beneficial due to the time constraints. So being able to start SAS, enhance python skills and develop power bi were solid enough for me, as s opposed to dabbling 5-7 new ones. Yes, when I looked at the current workers of Bupa on LinkedIn I realized sas was common amongst them and knew it wa a necessary skill. I can’t remember if it was explicitly communicated before joining asides the interviews, but if it isn’t it may help to let people some preliminary learning before coming. Though there isn’t s much help on sas trainings freely available.


2. Oh yes, the hybrid part was brilliant, I had thought I d come in more freq to be honest but I realised I work better and deeper at home, but having the flexibility to be bale to come into the office and see others as well was a relieving benefit, and the office at Bupa place is magnificent so no reason why one wouldn’t want to come in from time to time.

3. For me I had to sacrifice all my weekends to learn, put what had been learnt into work while also taking on the technical challenge, I don’t expect such extreme measures from everyone. But seeing as it was a short time I did put in as much work as was needed and I personally think this should be encourage. For people who may not have the luxury of such sacrifices, I think communication from both sides would be beneficial as the technical challenge can be quite tasking, mostly because you have several back to back meeting with your teammates and have to put in some good work and thinking into the work. Milan was helpful as some days before submitting I was able to get 3-6 hours from work time to devote into the project with was helpful.
4. 
5. Not particularly, I think most of the other projects common to other orgs are synonymous  with what we’d do during masters or say any academia based work. Bupa’s while being a commercial angle had an element of learning and working towards targets that’s different but still useful in the present job market. I think it’s perfect the way it is.
6. I reckon an external project for interview may be beneficial but believe thats what the technical challenge was for for example the interviews I had I used that, but if An additional project on the side can be taken up to boost the interns skill. Then it would be perfect, but I think I appreciated the part of being able to contribute something useful to the organisation. So having a personal project outside of Bupa that is just for skill building and to add to ones portfolio without being used in a real life sense may not be as rewarding as the technical challenge and gaggle projects can suffice in that regard.

6. This is tricky for me, as I think I was just eager to learn and see how my skills could benefit the organisation, and when the dataset had some diseases and procedure undergone it always brought me some sense of joy and keenest so yes it should be of interest fro those who have a strong healthcare background to want to do think health related specifically as I may have wanted more of that. But from the casual talks with the interns, a lot do not have the health background and are open to internship in data sceincehinestly. So I think it would have to be on per person basis, maybe garner what they’d be more keen on doing. I love having something outside health data to eb honest as I had me head down with some of those with the technical challenge. So it should be a personal bases.
7.  It was definitely useful and was clear at lest during my first call with Milan before I joined, I wonder if having say 7 weeks with say you team on a small sized project an done on sau John teams with more health-data maybe possible.  I definitely would have enjoyed that, and there is time for that if the future projects are as concise while being very involving as the NPS project Milan put me on. I think there can be time for two good sized projects that prepare interns for the future with health commercial or any private company and a future with health elated data. Would definelty be more than helpful as opposed to just one sid.

In genral the uniquenssof Bupa manors the other orgs is a thing to be envied, i think many interns envied me haha, and I must sau I desered it. I don’t forget to sing theorise of interning here, and whether it’s just commercial dates or having to get amixtureof both would be more than beneficial for the interns. 



Absolutely, here's your feedback with improvements for clarity:

**1. Focus on Key Technologies:** I found that delving deep into a select few technologies (like SAS, enhancing Python skills, and developing Power BI) was incredibly beneficial, considering our time constraints. It would be helpful to communicate the importance of certain skills, like SAS, before joining. While there isn't an abundance of freely available SAS training, preliminary learning resources could be provided to ease the initial learning curve.

**2. Excellent Hybrid Work Arrangement:** The flexibility of a hybrid work model was a pleasant surprise. Initially, I thought I'd be in the office more frequently, but I soon realized that I was more productive working from home. However, having the option to come to the office was a welcome benefit. Bupa's office space is quite impressive, making it an attractive option for occasional in-person work.

**3. Dedication and Sacrifice:** Personally, I was willing to dedicate my weekends to learning, applying what I'd learned, and tackling the technical challenges. While I understand that not everyone can make such extreme commitments, especially considering the short duration of the internship, I believe that putting in extra effort should be encouraged. For those who might not have the same flexibility, clear communication between interns and the organization would be beneficial. The technical challenges can be demanding, particularly when juggling multiple meetings with teammates. I found Milan's support, which allowed me to allocate work hours to the project, particularly helpful.

**4. Project Variety and Learning:** Bupa's projects offer a unique blend of learning and working towards commercial targets, which sets them apart from typical academic work. This approach is incredibly valuable in today's job market, and I believe it's perfectly structured.

**5. External Projects:** While the technical challenge served as a valuable component for interviews, an additional external project for skill enhancement could be beneficial. However, it's worth noting that many interns appreciate the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to the organization. Therefore, any personal projects should be optional, aimed at skill-building and portfolio enhancement, rather than real-life application.

**6. Tailoring Projects to Interests:** The choice of projects should be flexible and based on individual interests and expertise. While I personally enjoyed working on healthcare-related data, I also understand that some interns may not have a healthcare background and are open to diverse data science projects. Thus, project assignments should be tailored to each intern's preferences.

**7. Project Duration:** I initially understood that my role would involve less health-related data. However, I wonder if extending the duration of projects, perhaps with Saul's team on a smaller project and then Juhi's team on a project involving more health-related data, might be possible. I would have certainly appreciated that. Given the engaging and concise nature of the NPS project Milan assigned me, there could be room for two substantial projects. Such an approach would better prepare interns for roles in health data, commercial data, or private companies.

In summary, Bupa's uniqueness compared to other organizations is truly enviable, and I believe many interns share this sentiment. The balance between commercial and health-related projects offers a well-rounded internship experience. Considering the interns' varied backgrounds and career aspirations, a mix of both types of projects could be highly beneficial.

Certainly, here's a letter from an intern to future interns, expressing encouragement and offering valuable tips:
