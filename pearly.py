Here's a clearer summary of the setup:

1. **Backup Sources:**
   - There are two backup sources:
     - **Backup PC for the Gateway:** This serves as a backup for the Gateway.
     - **Backup SIM Card:** This serves as a secondary source of internet connectivity, which can be used if the primary LAN or primary sim connection fails. The router supports two SIM cards by secondary I mean secondary sim.

2. **Levrton's Configuration:**
   - Leverton has a single control and a single enhanced telemetry system.
   - Leverton's router like others supports two SIM cards, and both are in use.
   - One of the SIM cards serves as a backup source for both control and enhanced telemetry. In case of primary connectivity failure, it switches to the backup SIM.

3. **Other Sites' Configuration:**
   - Other sites also have backup SIM cards, but the backup SIM serves the control telemetry only, not the enhanced telemetry.

4. **Winchester's Configuration:**
   - Winchester has a backup PC for both control and enhanced telemetry.
   - Additionally, there is a 4G backup SIM for control telemetry.

In summary, Leverton's configuration is unique in that it uses a single backup SIM for both control and enhanced telemetry. The other sites have backup SIMs that serve as backups for control telemetry only. Winchester has a backup PC for both control and enhanced telemetry an onsite LAN and a separate 4G backup SIM for control telemetry only.
