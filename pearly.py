Following our investigation, we've determined that the controller at the site we're connected to is consistently reporting a value of 0 on the max discharge power Modbus register. This suggests an issue originating from the controller's end. Consequently, our gateway is receiving 0, leading to the miscalculation of the max power as 0.
